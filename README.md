# API Integration and Data Visualization

## Description
This project is part of my internship task with **CodTech**. The goal is to integrate data from a public API (OpenWeatherMap) and visualize it using Python libraries such as **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. The project demonstrates fetching real-time weather data for cities and creating informative visualizations.

## Features
- Fetch real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Extract key parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- Visualize the data using bar charts, line plots, and other graphs.
- Optionally analyze trends across multiple cities.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for scripting.
- **Requests**: To fetch data from the API.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating bar charts and other visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
